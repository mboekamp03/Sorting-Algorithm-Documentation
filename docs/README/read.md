# Sorting Algorithm Developer Documentation

## Overview

Welcome to our Sorting Algorithm Visualizer and Timer project! This repository contains a comprehensive program designed to visually demonstrate and time various sorting algorithms. It's an excellent tool for educational purposes, understanding algorithm efficiency, and performance analysis.

## Features

1. Visual Representation: See how different sorting algorithms work in real time.
2. Timing Metrics: Get precise timing data for each algorithm's performance.
3. Multiple Algorithms: Includes Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and more.

## Installation

## SDL2 Steps on macOS:
1. Go to the SDL website: https://www.libsdl.org/
2. Click SDL Releases under Downloads on the left side of the website, this will direct you to SDLâ€™s latest release on GitHub
3. Click the download that is correct for your computer
4. To skip this step click the following for Macbooks: https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/download/release-2.28.1/SDL2-2.28.1.dmg&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1690251149138911&usg=AOvVaw2SU3_hxGrFtx0p9yjDeuYV
5. Clicking here will download the correct file
6. From here, open a new finder window by right clicking the finder icon and selecting New Finder Window near the top
7. On the top of your screen, select Go
8. Then, select Go to Folder
9. This will bring up a text box saying Go to Folder, click into this and paste the following: /Library/Frameworks
10. Hit enter, then you will see the Frameworks folder on your Macbook
11. Go back to the open SDL2 file and drag the framework into the Frameworks folder
12. Use git clone to clone this repository
13. From here, run make to create an executable
14. Run the executable:

 ```
  ./program <file_name>.txt <mode>
 ```
15.  You can use the following modes:

      0: Insertion Sort

      1: Merge Sort

      2: Quicksort

      3: Radix Sort

## Pandas
1. For the timing program, the only thing you must have installed is pandas
2. To do this, type `pip install pandas` into the terminal:
